# Genotype imputation using Bidirectional-RNN/LSTM.


Current version uses the geno_loc_new.txt file which contains SNPs from around positions: 9900 - 10000 in the 1000genomes dataset. The dataset has been preprocessed such that the 0/1 distribution along each SNP is between 0.3 and 0.7. 


TO DO LIST

1) Calculate r^2 correlation values to compare with the ground truth.

2) Measure concordance values (if required).
