# Bidirectional-LSTM
Project code for Bidirectional LSTM

1) Unidirectional RNN-LSTM

2) Bidirectional RNN-LSTM

NOTE: Running the bidirectional RNN-LSTM requires a small change in the model. For this you need to go into the built in function rnn.py in the Tensorflow library and change the rnn.birectional
