===================================================================
Authors: Deepak Muralidharan and Manikandan Srinivasan
--------
Course project for CM229 (Instructor: Prof Sriram Sankararaman)

The folder contains the code for the following methods:
  - Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network for Diploid/Haploid genotype data. (bi_haploid_training, bi_diploid_training, bi_haploid_testing, bi_diploid_testing)
  - Unidirectional Recurrent Neural Network for Diploid/haploid genotype data. (uni_haploid_training, uni_haploid_testing)
  - Robust PCA based imputation method for Diploid/haploid genotype data. (robust_pca_main.m)
